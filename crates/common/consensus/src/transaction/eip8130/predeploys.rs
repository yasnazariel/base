//! Addresses for EIP-8130 system contracts and precompiles.
//!
//! # Deployment model
//!
//! **Precompiles** (native code, no EVM bytecode, fixed addresses):
//!   - `NonceManager` (`0x…aa02`)  — 2D nonce reads
//!   - `TxContext`     (`0x…aa03`)  — AA transaction metadata
//!
//! **Deployed contracts** (Solidity, deployed at BASE_V1 activation via
//! `TxDeposit` upgrade transactions — see `base_consensus_upgrades::BaseV1`):
//!   - `AccountConfiguration` — owner registrations, account creation, locks
//!   - `P256Verifier`, `WebAuthnVerifier`, `DelegateVerifier`
//!   - `DefaultAccount` — wallet implementation for EIP-7702 auto-delegation
//!
//! All deployed contract addresses are deterministic: `Deployers::BASE_V1_*.create(0)`.
//! On devnets with BASE_V1 active from genesis, the derivation pipeline injects
//! the upgrade deposit transactions at block 0.

/// rule from re-authorizing the account on an empty slot. Non-self owners

// changes must be rejected until the contract is deployed.

// A stale `false` just triggers one extra DB code-existence check.
